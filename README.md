Prisons and Pythons
===================
Coding a text-based RPG for Programming for Biology 2017 at CSHL
----

The goal of this project is to collaboratively develop a text-based RPG as a coding exercise in Python.


Installation
----
In order to download the code, you must use git to pull down the repo:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/bredeson/PnP.git
```

Play
---
In order to play the game, you must have Python3 installed. To begin playing `cd` into the PnP repo and invoke:
```sh
python3 ./Prisons_and_Pythons.py
```

#### Obtaining the original PFB2017 PnP version
This codebase is still in active development. If you'd like to play the version of the game presented at the end of the 2017 Programming for Biology Course, please `cd` into the PnP repo and issue the following command in your Terminal before running the game:

```sh
git checkout v1.0-pfb
